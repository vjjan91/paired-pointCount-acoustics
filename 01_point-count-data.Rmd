# Exploring point-count data  

In this script, we will explore the point-count data to understand bird species diversity patterns across seasons. For this analysis, we rely on two seasons of point-count data, that was carried out in June 2024 and Dec 2024.  

## Install required libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
library(scico)
library(data.table)
library(extrafont)
library(sf)
library(raster)

# for plotting
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggspatial)
library(colorspace)
library(scico)
library(paletteer)

# Source any custom/other internal functions necessary for analysis
source("code/01_internal-functions.R")
```

## Loading point-count data
```{r}
# load two seasons of point-count data
point_counts <- read.csv("data/point-count-data.csv")

# removing all mammal species and unidentified bird species
point_counts <- point_counts %>%
  filter(birdMamm == "Bird")

# Using gsub to remove text within parentheses including the parentheses
point_counts$eBirdIndiaName2023 <- gsub("\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)", "", point_counts$eBirdIndiaName2023)

# add species scientific name to the point-count data 
sci_name <- read.csv("data/species-taxonomy.csv")
sci_name$eBirdIndiaName2023 <- gsub("\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)", "", sci_name$eBirdIndiaName2023)

# add scientific_name to the point_count data
point_counts <- left_join(point_counts[,-7], sci_name[,-c(1,2,4)])

# rename columns
names(point_counts)[4] <- "start_time"
names(point_counts)[7] <- "common_name"
names(point_counts)[12] <- "scientific_name"

# write to file
write.csv(point_counts, "results/cleaned-point-count-data.csv", row.names = F)
```

## Load site level information and create gridded data
```{r}
# we write a function below to create a grid around the centroid of each location of size 1ha
# the grid is primarily created for visualizing species richness & other associated metrics (this step is optional)

# function to create square grid around a point
create_square_grid <- function(lon, lat, size_ha = 1) {
  
  # convert hectares to degrees (approximate conversion)
  # 1 ha = 100m x 100m
  # at the equator, 1 degree is approximately 111,320 meters
  # so we need to convert 100m to degrees
  
  size_degrees <- sqrt(size_ha) * 100 / 111320
  
  # Create a square polygon
  coords <- matrix(c(
    lon - size_degrees/2, lat - size_degrees/2,  # bottom left
    lon + size_degrees/2, lat - size_degrees/2,  # bottom right
    lon + size_degrees/2, lat + size_degrees/2,  # top right
    lon - size_degrees/2, lat + size_degrees/2,  # top left
    lon - size_degrees/2, lat - size_degrees/2   # close the polygon
  ), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
  
  # Create polygon
  pol <- st_polygon(list(coords))
  return(pol)
}

# function to obtain the latitude and longitude from a .csv file and create an associated shapefile
create_grid_shapefile <- function(csv_path, output_shp, lon_col = "longitude", lat_col = "latitude") {
  
  # read CSV file
  data <- read.csv(csv_path)
  
  # create list to store polygons
  polygons <- list()
  
  # create square grid for each point
  for(i in 1:nrow(data)) {
    polygons[[i]] <- create_square_grid(
      data[[lon_col]][i],
      data[[lat_col]][i]
    )
  }
  
  # convert to sf object
  grid_sf <- st_sf(
    # Include original data
    data,
    # Convert polygon list to geometry
    geometry = st_sfc(polygons, crs = 4326)
  )
  
  # write to shapefile
  st_write(grid_sf, output_shp, driver = "ESRI Shapefile", append = FALSE)
  
  return(grid_sf)
}

# site-level information
sites <- "data/sites.csv"

# Create the grid shapefile

  output_shp = grid_shp,
  lon_col = "decimalLongitude",  # replace with your longitude column name
  lat_col = "decimalLatitude"    # replace with your latitude column name
)
```

## Extract species-level information
```{r}

# write to file

# total abundance by species for each season across grids
totAbundance_by_season <- abundance %>%
  group_by(common_name, seasonYear) %>%
  summarise(totAbundance = sum(abundance))

# species most abundant across seasons include the Yellow-browed Bulbul, Southern Hill Myna, Crimson-backed Sunbird, Greater Racket-tailed Drongo 

# estimate richness for point count data (calculated for each site)
richness <- abundance %>%
  mutate(forRichness = case_when(abundance > 0 ~ 1)) %>%
